# Scala Memos
In this repo, you can find my personal memos I took to keep tracking of the context of Scala while learning it.

    0-Internal Function
    1-Partially Applied Function
    2-Closures - First-class Functions
    3-Higher-order Functions
    4-Pass Parameter by using curly braces
    5-By-name Parameters
